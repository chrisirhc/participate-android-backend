Participate! Backend

This is our CS3248 project for NUS.
This part requires the JoyEnt Smart Platform to run. (http://www.joyent.com/products/joyent-smart-platform/)

To run it locally, for Mac users, you can use what's found at:
http://download.smart.joyent.com/latest

Otherwise, you have to build the installation from the git repositories at:
http://github.com/joyent/smart-platform/

This is a combination of three repositories:
http://github.com/gabrielxw/participate-ambient
http://github.com/chrisirhc/participate-android
